# Micrograd from Scratch

This repository contains an implementation of Andrej Karpathy's micrograd neural network library from scratch, following his [Micrograd tutorial](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd). The purpose of this project is to understand the inner workings of neural networks and gradient descent algorithms by coding them from the ground up.
